# Shoshin Trading Journal

![Shoshin Trading Journal Logo](images/Shoshin.png)

## Description

Shoshin Trading Journal is a web application designed to help traders track and analyze their trading activities. The name "Shoshin" comes from Zen Buddhism, meaning "beginner's mind," emphasizing the importance of an open, eager, and unprejudiced mind in trading.

This application allows users to:
- Log their trades with detailed information
- View a dashboard with basic trading statistics
- Analyze their trading patterns and performance

I ended up creating this application because as a trader myself I wanted to create a journal application to help myself but potentially be something bigger. 

## Getting Started
